## Introduction

This project focuses on the manual testing of the Sign-Up and Log-In functionalities of Daraz, a leading e-commerce platform. The primary goal is to practice manual testing while creating comprehensive documentation to assist beginners in understanding the testing process. During the practice, several issues were identified that could potentially benefit Daraz's SQA team in improving the platform's quality.. As part of this project, key testing artifacts were developed like Test Plan, Mind Map, Test Cases, Test Case Report, Bug Report and Test Metrics.
## Test Plan
A test plan in manual testing is a document that outlines the objectives, scope, approach, resources, schedule, and deliverables of the testing process. It acts as a roadmap to guide the testing team, ensuring clarity and consistency throughout the testing lifecycle. Here is the Test Plan for this project-

## Mind Map

The attached mind map summarizes the manual testing of the Sign-Up and Login functionalities for Daraz Bangladesh. The testing covered various scenarios, including validation of phone numbers, email, password, and third-party logins (Facebook and Google). Some tests passed, such as password validation, third-party logins, and the Forgot Password feature. However, several issues were identified, including problems with phone number validation, issues with the gender field and full name accepting numbers in the Sign-Up process, and input length limits for phone/email in the Login section. Overall, this mind map provides a clear view of both the successful and failed test cases for user management.
## Test Cases
A total of 58 test cases were executed for the Sign-Up and Login process, where 17 issues were identified.
## Test Case Report

## Bug Report
During the tesing these bugs were identified-
## Test Metrics

In manual testing, **test metrics** are quantitative measures used to assess the effectiveness, efficiency, and quality of the testing process. They provide valuable insights into various aspects of the testing phase, such as test coverage, defect identification, and the overall progress of the testing effort. Test metrics help track performance, ensure that testing is thorough, and identify areas for improvement. These metrics can include things like the number of test cases executed, the percentage of passed or failed test cases, defect density, and defect removal efficiency, among others. They are essential for making data-driven decisions, improving testing strategies, and reporting testing outcomes to stakeholders.
